<p><b>Difference Between Var,Let and Constant</b></p>
<p>i. The scope of a var variable is functional scope. The scope of a let variable is block scope.The scope of a const
    variable is block scope.</p>
<p>
    ii.Var can be accessed without initialization as its default value is “undefined”.Let cannot be accessed without
    initialization otherwise it will give ‘referenceError’.Const cannot be accessed without initialization, as it cannot
    be declared without initialization.

<p><b>Why we use template string</b></p>
<p>
    Template literals are literals delimited with backtick (`) characters, allowing for multi-line strings, for string
    interpolation with embedded expressions, and for special constructs called tagged templates.

    Template literals are sometimes informally called template strings, because they are used most commonly for string
    interpolation (to create strings by doing substitution of placeholders). However, a tagged template literal may not
    result in a string; it can be used with a custom tag function to perform whatever operations you want on the
    different parts of the template literal.

<p><b>Difference between regular function and arrow function</b></p>
<p>i.In regular function, Arguments keywords can be used to access the arguments of which passed to function.However, if
    you want to access arguments in an arrow function, you can use the rest operator:</p>
<p>ii. Regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword.However, arrow functions can never
    be used as constructor functions. Hence, they can never be invoked with the new keyword</p>
